## Bugs and Fixes
### Issue 1: Preserving Category Value
**Bug:** When starting a new game or moving to the next word, the category value is not preserved.

**Fix:** To address this issue, the `localStorage` is used to store and retrieve the current category. When starting a game or moving to the next word, the category is stored in `localStorage` and fetched when needed.

``` javascript
function redirectToCategoryPage() {
    const currentCategory = localStorage.getItem('category');
    localStorage.setItem(`${currentCategory}_wordIndex`, 0);
    window.location.href = 'category.html';
}
```

### Issue 2: Avoiding Word Repetition
**Bug:** Words can be repeated when the user plays the game, leading to a less challenging experience.

**Fix:** The code now keeps track of the word index for each category in `localStorage`. It ensures that a word is not repeated until all words in the category have been used. If there are no more words in the category, the user is notified, ensuring a diverse and engaging gameplay experience.

```javascript
function getWord(category) {
    const wordsByCategory = {
        // ... (Words for different categories remain unchanged)
    };

    if (category && wordsByCategory.hasOwnProperty(category)) {
        const words = wordsByCategory[category];

        if (words && words.length > 0) {
            let wordIndex = parseInt(localStorage.getItem(`${category}_wordIndex`) || 0);

            if (wordIndex < words.length) {
                const selectedWord = words[wordIndex];
                localStorage.setItem(`${category}_wordIndex`, wordIndex + 1);

                return selectedWord;
            } else {
                console.log('No more words in the category.');
                return null;
            }
        } else {
            console.error('Category has no words.');
        }
    }

    return null;
}

```
### Issue 3: Improved Alert Display
**Bug:** The alert messages were basic and needed improvement for a better user experience.

**Fix:** The code now utilizes the SweetAlert2 library to display more visually appealing and informative alerts. Different icons and styles are used for success, warning, and error messages, providing a more engaging and user-friendly interface.

```javascript
Swal.fire({
                    icon: 'error',
                    title: 'Oops, You Lose!',
                    text: `Don't worry, you'll get it next time! The word was: ${secretWord}. Keep trying and have fun!`,
                    confirmButtonText: 'OK'
                }).then(() => {
                   
                   window.location.href = 'index.html';
                });
```

### Issue 4: Replacing Dashes with Chosen Letters
**Bug:** The challenge was to replace the dashes in the displayed word with the letters chosen by the user during the game.

**Fix:** The code has been modified to dynamically replace the dashes in the displayed word with the correct letters chosen by the user. 

```javascript
function updateWordDisplay(selectedWord, selectedLetter) {
    const wordContainer = document.getElementById('word');
    if (wordContainer) {
        const wordArray = selectedWord.split('');
        let updatedWord = wordContainer.textContent.split(' ');

        let isLetterCorrect = false;

        for (let i = 0; i < wordArray.length; i++) {
            if (wordArray[i] === selectedLetter) {
                updatedWord[i] = selectedLetter;
                isLetterCorrect = true;
            }
        }
        const displayWord = updatedWord.join(' ');
        wordContainer.textContent = displayWord;

        // ... (Rest of the code)
    }
}

```

### Issue 5: Creating the Game Board
**Bug:** The initial implementation lacked a dynamically created game board, affecting the overall interactivity of the game.

**Fix:** The code now dynamically generates the game board, consisting of letter buttons representing the alphabet.

```javascript
function setupGameBoard() {
    const gameBoardContainer = document.getElementById('game-board');
    if (gameBoardContainer) {
        const alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
        const alphabetArray = alphabet.split('');

        alphabetArray.forEach(letter => {
            const letterButton = document.createElement('button');
            letterButton.textContent = letter;
            letterButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
                handleLetterClick(letter);
            });
            gameBoardContainer.appendChild(letterButton);
        });
    }
}

```
